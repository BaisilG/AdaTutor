<h2>The Tower of Hanoi Problem</h2>

<p>The &ldquo;Tower of Hanoi&rdquo; is a solitaire puzzle that was named when
Hanoi was the capital of a free country: French Indochina.&nbsp;  There are
three pegs labeled A, B, and C; one of them has a tower of N doughnut-shaped
disks of decreasing size, like this:
<pre>

          |                    |                    |
          |                    |                    |
         =|=                   |                    |
        ==|==                  |                    |
       ===|===                 |                    |
      ====|====                |                    |
     =====|=====               |                    |
  -----------------    -----------------    -----------------
          A                    B                    C
</pre>
</p>

<p>The object is to move the entire tower from one peg to another, say, from A
to B.&nbsp;  Only one disk may be moved at a time, and a larger disk may never
be placed on top of a smaller one.&nbsp;  The shortest solution to the puzzle
with N disks requires 2**N - 1 moves.</p>

<p>For example, we can move five disks from A to B with the following 31 moves:
(Read them from left to right, not in columns.)</p>

<pre>
A to B,  A to C,  B to C,  A to B,  C to A,  C to B,
A to B,  A to C,  B to C,  B to A,  C to A,  B to C,
A to B,  A to C,  B to C,  A to B,  C to A,  C to B,
A to B,  C to A,  B to C,  B to A,  C to A,  C to B,
A to B,  A to C,  B to C,  A to B,  C to A,  C to B,
A to B.</pre>

                    (The Puzzle After the First Five Moves)
</pre>

<p>Writing a program to display this series of moves would be very complicated
without recursion.&nbsp;  Let's develop a recursive solution; we'll see that the
resulting Ada program is surprisingly simple!</p>

<p>When we developed a recursive solution for the Factorial function:
<pre>
          if N = 1,  Factorial(N) = 1
          otherwise, Factorial(N) = N * Factorial(N - 1)
</pre>
we expressed Factorial(N) in terms of Factorial(N - 1), and gave the trivial
solution for N = 1.&nbsp;  The Ada program was easily written from the
above.</p>

<p>For the Tower of Hanoi problem, let's develop a solution for N disks in terms
of a solution for N - 1 disks.&nbsp;  Suppose we want to move five disks from A
to B, using C as a spare peg.&nbsp;  We first move <b>four</b> disks from A to
<b>C</b>, then move one disk from A to B, and finally move four disks from C to
B.&nbsp;  In general, to move N disks from a source peg to a destination peg,
we first move N - 1 disks from the source to the spare, then move one disk from
the source to the destination, and finally move N - 1 disks from the spare to
the destination.</p>

<p>To move the <b>one</b> disk from the source to the destination, our program
will simply display the move.&nbsp;  To move N - 1 disks, the program will call
itself.&nbsp; The solution for zero disks is trivial indeed: the program will do
nothing!</p>

<p>The following program is extremely simple: three executable statements inside
an <b>if</b> block.&nbsp;  Yet it can display a very complicated series of
moves!</p>

   <span class="hl kwa">if</span> N <span class="hl opt">&gt;</span> <span class="hl num">0</span> <span class="hl kwa">then</span>
      Hanoi<span class="hl opt">(</span>N <span class="hl opt">-</span> <span class="hl num">1</span><span class="hl opt">,</span> From<span class="hl opt">,</span> Spare<span class="hl opt">,</span> To<span class="hl opt">);</span>
      Put_Line<span class="hl opt">(</span>From <span class="hl opt">&amp;</span> <span class="hl str">&quot; to &quot;</span> <span class="hl opt">&amp;</span> To<span class="hl opt">);</span>
      Hanoi<span class="hl opt">(</span>N <span class="hl opt">-</span> <span class="hl num">1</span><span class="hl opt">,</span> Spare<span class="hl opt">,</span> To<span class="hl opt">,</span> From<span class="hl opt">);</span>
   <span class="hl kwa">end if</span><span class="hl opt">;</span>
<span class="hl kwa">end</span> Hanoi<span class="hl opt">;</span>
</pre>

<p>To move five disks from A to B, using C as a spare, we would call
<b>Hanoi(5, 'A', 'B', 'C');</b> and the program would display the 31 moves.</p>

<p>Note that when Hanoi is called with N = 0, it does nothing.&nbsp;  When
called with N = 1, the if statement is true, and the three lines within the
<b>if</b> block are executed.&nbsp;  But the first and third lines do nothing,
because they call Hanoi with N = 0.&nbsp;  The second line displays, for
example, <b>A to B</b>.</p>

<p>When called with a larger value of N, the first line within the if block
moves N - 1 disks from the source to the spare peg.&nbsp;  The second line
displays the move of one disk from the source to the destination, and the third
line moves N - 1 disks from the spare peg to the destination.</p>

<p>Most implementations of Ada won't allow Hanoi to be a main program, because
it has parameters.&nbsp; A short main program to call Hanoi is shown here.&nbsp;
A slightly longer program could get N and the names of the three pegs from the
user.&nbsp;  In this example, procedure Demo <b>with</b>s a previously compiled
<b>procedure</b> rather than a previously compiled <b>package</b>.&nbsp;  We
never write a <b>use</b> clause for a procedure or a function, because dot
notation doesn't apply, as it does for packages.</p>

<pre class="hl"><span class="hl kwa">with</span> Hanoi<span class="hl opt">;</span>
<span class="hl kwa">procedure</span> Demo <span class="hl kwa">is</span>
<span class="hl kwa">begin</span>
   Hanoi<span class="hl opt">(</span><span class="hl num">5</span><span class="hl opt">,</span> <span class="hl str">'A'</span><span class="hl opt">,</span> <span class="hl str">'B'</span><span class="hl opt">,</span> <span class="hl str">'C'</span><span class="hl opt">);</span>
<span class="hl kwa">end</span> Demo<span class="hl opt">;</span>
</pre>

<p>In summary, our first example of recursion, Factorial, was very simple.&nbsp;
However, that program would have been simple even without recursion.&nbsp;  Our
second example, Hanoi, also was very simple, but the program would have been
quite complicated without recursion.</p>

<p>Our fourth Outside Assignment will be to write a Fibonacci function Fib,
using recursion.&nbsp;  As with Factorial, this function would be easy to write
even without recursion.&nbsp;  However, as an exercise we'll write it using
recursion.</p>
