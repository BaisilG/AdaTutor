<p>This process of creating an <b>instance</b> of the generic package
Integer_IO for the type Integer is called <b>generic instantiation</b>.&nbsp;
Later in this course we'll learn to write our own generic packages, procedures,
and functions.&nbsp;  However, we wanted to learn, early in the course, how to
instantiate an already written generic package in order to display integers.
</p>

<p>But why does Ada make Ada.Text_IO ready-to-use for Strings, while Integer_IO
is generic, and has to be instantiated for Integers?&nbsp;  Because programs
normally use only one type String, but can have several integer types.&nbsp;
Right now, we know of only one integer type, the standard Integer.&nbsp;  Later
we'll learn about user-defined types and derived types, and we'll see how there
can be many integer types.&nbsp;  Integer_IO can be instantiated for each of
these types.</p>

<p>Ada 95 provides a ready-to-use package <b>Ada.Integer_Text_IO</b>,
which is equivalent to the package we obtain by instantiating
Ada.Text_IO.Integer_IO for the type Integer.&nbsp;  Thus, with an Ada 95
compiler, the above program wouldn't have to do its own instantiation of
Integer_IO; instead, it could have added <b>Ada.Integer_Text_IO</b> to both the
<b>with</b> and the <b>use</b> clause.&nbsp; However not all Ada 83 compilers
provide such a package, and those that do use a non-standard name, such as IIO.
</p>

<p>There's another generic package within Ada.Text_IO called Float_IO.&nbsp;
Input and output of floating point numbers is done by instantiating Float_IO
for the type Float.&nbsp;  As with integers, we'll later learn how there can be
several floating point types besides the standard Float; that's why
Ada.Text_IO.Float_IO is generic.&nbsp;  (Ada 95 provides us with a ready-to-use
package called Ada.Float_Text_IO, equivalent to the package we obtain by
instantiating Ada.Text_IO.Float_IO for the type Float.&nbsp;  However, not all
Ada 83 compilers provide a similar package, and those that do use a
non-standard name like FIO.)</p> 

<p>Later in this course, when we cover attributes, we'll learn another way to
display Integers (and, in Ada 95, Floats as well), by using the <b>'Image</b>
attribute.</p>

<p>We're now ready for our first Outside Assignment!&nbsp;  Let's compile and
run our two sample programs, Hello and Add.&nbsp;  The files
<a href='../adatutor/hello.ada'>HELLO.ADA</a> and
<a href='../adatutor/add.ada'>ADD.ADA</a> are already supplied for you, and
they're written to work with Ada 83 compilers as well as Ada 95.&nbsp;  (That's
why they say simply Text_IO instead of Ada.Text_IO.)</p>
