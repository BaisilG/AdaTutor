AdaTutor in HTML
================

[AdaTutor](http://www.adatutor.com/) is an Ada 95 tutorial program written
by John J. Herro.  It has been placed into public domain by John.

It is a great tutorial although it only touches on Ada 95 and does not
contain information for Ada 2005 and 2012.

Here I have the AdaTutor presented on the Web.

You could visit [my blog](http://blog.zsoft.ca/2012/08/adatutor.html) to
browse directly on the web.
