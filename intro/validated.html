<a name="i-validated"></a><h2>What's a "Validated" Ada Compiler?</h2>
<p>Ada compilers (and cross compilers) are now validated by the National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).&nbsp;  If a compiler conforms
exactly to the standard, and isn't a subset or superset of Ada, it's validated
after passing an extensive suite of tests (called the Ada Compiler Validation
Capability, or ACVC).&nbsp;  The ACVC is updated periodically.</p>

<p>Since March 1997, all validated compilers conform to the newer Ada 95
standard, because the validation on all Ada 83 compilers has expired.</p>

<h2>Question</h2>
<p>
<a href="javascript:adat_toggle('adat-ia5', 'adat-ia6');">True</a> or
<a href="javascript:adat_toggle('adat-ia6', 'adat-ia5');">False</a>?&nbsp;
 Subsets and supersets of standard Ada may be called "Ada."</p>

<div id='adat-ia5' class='adat-a' style="display: none">
    <p><strong>You're right! </strong>&nbsp; Compilers not conforming exactly
    to the Ada standard may be called "Ada" if the documentation contains a
    clear statement that they don't conform.</p>

    <p>Of course, <strong>validated</strong> compilers can't be subsets or
    supersets of standard Ada.&nbsp; They must conform exactly to the standard
    to be validated.</p>
</div>

<div id='adat-ia6' class='adat-a' style="display: none"><p>True.&nbsp; It's a
    common misconception that subsets and supersets may not be called
    "Ada."&nbsp; However, this was allowed even when "Ada" was a DoD
    trademark.&nbsp; Compilers not conforming to the standard may be called
    "Ada" if there's a clear statement that they don't conform.</p>
    
    <p>It's true, however, that <strong>validated</strong> Ada compilers
    can't be subsets or supersets of standard Ada.</p>
</div>

<p>
<a href="javascript:adat_toggle('adat-ia7', 'adat-ia8');">True</a> or
<a href="javascript:adat_toggle('adat-ia8', 'adat-ia7');">False</a>?&nbsp; 
The Validation tests are performed to provide reasonable assurance that a
compiler is bug-free.</p>

<div id='adat-ia7' class='adat-a' style="display: none">False.&nbsp;  That's a
    common misconception, but validation only determines that a compiler
    conforms exactly to the Ada standard, and isn't a subset or superset.&nbsp;
    A compiler isn't believed to be bug-free just because it earned a
    Validation Certificate.

<div id='adat-ia8' class='adat-a' style="display: none">
    <strong>You're right!</strong>&nbsp;  The Validation tests are performed to
    make sure that a compiler conforms to the Ada standard, and isn't a subset
