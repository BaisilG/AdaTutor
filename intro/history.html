<h2>A Very Brief History of Ada</h2>
<p>Ada was named for Augusta Ada Byron, countess of Lovelace and daughter of
the poet Lord Byron.&nbsp;  She worked with Charles Babbage on his Analytical
Engine, and has been called the world's first programmer.</p>

<p>Ada was invented because the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) realized that
none of the existing languages was very suitable for real-time control of
large, embedded systems.&nbsp;  An embedded system is a computer system inside
a product other than a computer, such as an intelligent oven or a guided
missile.&nbsp; Programs for embedded systems are usually written with a cross
compiler, a compiler that runs on one machine and produces code for
another.&nbsp;  Cross compilers are often called compilers for short.</p>

<p>In 1977 the DoD issued a Request for Proposal to develop a new language;
the leading four contenders were designated Blue, Red, Yellow, and Green.&nbsp;
Eventually Green was selected to be Ada; it was designed by the company
Honeywell Bull under the direction of Jean Ichbiah of France.</p>

<p>The name "Ada" is no longer a trademark of the Department of Defense.</p>
