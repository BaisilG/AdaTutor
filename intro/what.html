<h2>What Is Ada?</h2>
<p>Ada is a modern language designed for programming large scale and real time
systems.  Ada is also an excellent general purpose language.&nbsp;  It has many
new features which help prevent errors and detect errors earlier.</p>

<p>However, Ada is much more than a new language.&nbsp;  It's also a new
programming <b>philosophy</b>.&nbsp;  Beware of learning just "Ada syntax";
you'll wind up writing Basic-like (or Pascal-like, etc.) programs that happen
to be coded in Ada.&nbsp;  If you do that, you'll lose the many benefits of
Ada.&nbsp;  Unfortunately, you won't see why Ada is a new programming
philosophy until later in this course.&nbsp;  (By the time we get to packages
and information hiding, you'll be an enthusiastic convert.)&nbsp;  In the
meantime, please take our word for it:  Ada is a whole new programming
philosophy, not just another language.</p>

<p>Because of its many features, Ada is relatively complicated.&nbsp;  There's
about seven times as much to learn as Pascal.&nbsp;  However, the effort pays
great dividends.&nbsp;  Once you learn the language, Ada programs are easier
to write, easier to read, and much easier to modify a month or a year later.</p>
