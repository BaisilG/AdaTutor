<a name="i-what8395"></a><h2>What Are Ada 83 and Ada 95?</h2>
<p>The Ada language was standardized in 1980, and revised in 1983 and in
1995.&nbsp; The present version of Ada is called Ada 95, the previous version,
Ada 83.</p>

<p>During the early 1990's, it wasn't certain exactly when in the 90's the
second revision of Ada would be completed, so the upcoming revision was
referred to as Ada 9X.&nbsp;  Any references you see elsewhere to "Ada 9X"
mean Ada 95.</p>

<p>Since March 1997, all validated Ada compilers are Ada 95 compilers; the
validation on all Ada 83 compilers has expired.&nbsp;  The meaning of
"validation" will be discussed very shortly.</p>

<p>AdaTutor will point out the differences between Ada 83 and Ada 95 as we go
along.&nbsp;  All of the programs and examples in this course are designed to
compile and run with either an Ada 83 or an Ada 95 system, except for the
examples specifically labeled as Ada 95 only.</p>

<h2>Question</h2>
In the author's opinion, which <b>one</b> of the following statements is true?
<br />
<ol>
<li><a href="javascript:adat_toggle('adat-ia1');">Ada is simpler than Pascal.</a>
<div id="adat-ia1" class="adat-a" style="display: none"><p>No, Ada is more
    complicated than Pascal.&nbsp;  So far as the <b>philosophy</b> is
    concerned, Ada is an extension (or "superset") of Pascal.&nbsp;  However,
    in syntax Ada isn't a superset of Pascal; the Ada syntax is different.</p>
    
    <p>Although Ada is more complicated than Pascal (and many other languages),
    it has many advantages.&nbsp;  These advantages pay dividends in reduced
    effort to develop and maintain programs.</p></div>
</li>

<li><a href="javascript:adat_toggle('adat-ia2');">Although Ada was designed for
embedded systems, it makes a good general purpose language.</a>
<div id="adat-ia2" class="adat-a" style="display: none">
    <p><strong>You're right!</strong>&nbsp;  Ada makes use of the latest
    advances in software engineering, so it makes an excellent general purpose
    language.</p></div>
</li>

<li><a href="javascript:adat_toggle('adat-ia3');">Basic, C, and Pascal programs
can easily be translated into good Ada programs.</a>
<div id="adat-ia3" class="adat-a" style="display: none"><p>No, it might be easy
to translate Basic, C, and Pascal programs into Ada, but the resulting
programs wouldn't be very good, because they'd fail to take advantage of the
features of Ada.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="javascript:adat_toggle('adat-ia4');">In languages that are simpler
than Ada, errors are usually detected earlier than in Ada.</a>
<div id="adat-ia4" class="adat-a" style="display: none"><p>No, Ada has a
    reputation for detecting errors earlier than the simpler languages.&nbsp;
    Ada detects errors at compile time that other languages detect only at run
    time or not at all.&nbsp; Examples are calling a subprogram with the wrong
    number of parameters, and unintentionally mixing different types in an
    expression.&nbsp; We'll learn more about these things later.</p>
