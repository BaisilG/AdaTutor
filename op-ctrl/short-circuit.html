<h2>The Short Circuit Forms</h2>
<p>Suppose that <b>N</b> (for numerator) and <b>D</b> (for denominator) are
Floats, and we want to execute a block of code if the quotient is 10.0 or
greater.&nbsp;  We could write
<pre class="hl">   <span class="hl kwa">if</span> N<span class="hl opt">/</span>D <span class="hl opt">&gt;=</span> <span class="hl num">10.0</span> <span class="hl kwa">then</span>
      <span class="hl slc">-----;</span>
      <span class="hl slc">-----;  (block of code)</span>
      <span class="hl slc">-----;</span>
   <span class="hl kwa">end if</span><span class="hl opt">;</span>
</pre>

However, we realize that if <b>D</b> is 0.0, the program will raise a
Constraint_Error or Numeric_Error trying to compute <b>N/D</b>.&nbsp;  If the
denominator is zero, we consider the quotient to be very large, so we want to
execute the block of code when <b>D</b> is zero.  Our second attempt might be
<pre class="hl">   <span class="hl kwa">if</span> D <span class="hl opt">=</span> <span class="hl num">0.0</span> <span class="hl kwa">or</span> N<span class="hl opt">/</span>D <span class="hl opt">&gt;=</span> <span class="hl num">10.0</span> <span class="hl kwa">then</span>
      <span class="hl slc">-----;</span>
      <span class="hl slc">-----;  (block of code)</span>
      <span class="hl slc">-----;</span>
   <span class="hl kwa">end if</span><span class="hl opt">;</span>
</pre>
</p>

<p>Here we <b>hope</b> that <b>N/D</b> won't be evaluated if <b>D</b> is
zero.&nbsp; We figure that the compiler should be smart enough to know that if
the expression before <b>or</b> is True, then the whole expression must be
True, so the expression to the right of or needn't be evaluated.&nbsp;  However,
there's no guarantee that the compiler will write code to skip the evaluation of
the second expression when the first is True.&nbsp;  An optimizing compiler just
might, for some unknown reason, even decide that the expression on the right
should be evaluated first.</p>

<p>However, with the form <b>or else</b>, Ada can bypass (or "short circuit")
evaluating the expression on the right when the one on the left is true:
<pre class="hl">   <span class="hl kwa">if</span> D <span class="hl opt">=</span> <span class="hl num">0.0</span> <span class="hl kwa">or else</span> N<span class="hl opt">/</span>D <span class="hl opt">&gt;=</span> <span class="hl num">10.0</span> <span class="hl kwa">then</span>
      <span class="hl slc">-----;</span>
      <span class="hl slc">-----;  (block of code)</span>
      <span class="hl slc">-----;</span>
   <span class="hl kwa">end if</span><span class="hl opt">;</span>
</pre></p>

<p>Ada guarantees that the expression to the left of <b>or else</b> will be
evaluated first.&nbsp; If this expression is True, the entire expression must be
True, and it's guaranteed that the second expression won't be evaluated.&nbsp;
If the first expression is False, then of course the second expression must be
evaluated to determine if the entire expression is True.&nbsp;  Thus the code
above will never try to divide by zero.&nbsp;  If <b>D</b> is zero, the
expression on the left is True.&nbsp;  The expression on the right won't be
evaluated in that case.</p>

<p>There's another &ldquo;short circuit&rdquo; form called
<b>and then</b>.&nbsp;  If the expression to the left of <b>and then</b> is
False, the whole expression must be False, and the expression on the right
won't be evaluated.&nbsp;  If the expression on the left is True, then the
expression on the right must be evaluated to determine the value of the entire
expression.&nbsp;  Suppose this time that we want to execute a block of code if
N/D is <b>less than</b> 10.0.&nbsp;  If the denominator is zero, we consider the
quotient to be very large, and we don't want to execute the block of code in
that case.&nbsp;  We can write the following:
<pre class="hl">   <span class="hl kwa">if</span> D <span class="hl opt">=</span> <span class="hl num">0.0</span> <span class="hl kwa">and then</span> N<span class="hl opt">/</span>D <span class="hl opt">&lt;</span> <span class="hl num">10.0</span> <span class="hl kwa">then</span>
      <span class="hl slc">-----;</span>
      <span class="hl slc">-----;  (block of code)</span>
      <span class="hl slc">-----;</span>
   <span class="hl kwa">end if</span><span class="hl opt">;</span>
</pre>
</p>

<p>Again this protects us from trying to divide by zero.&nbsp;  If <b>D</b> is
zero, the expression on the left is False.&nbsp;  The second expression won't beevaluated in that case.</p>

<p>After we discuss arrays, we'll see how the short circuit forms can prevent us
from using out-of-range subscripts.&nbsp;  And when we learn about access types,
we'll see how the short circuit forms can keep us from dereferencing a null
access object (&ldquo;pointer&rdquo;).&nbsp;  That means trying to access
&ldquo;the object pointed to&rdquo; when there's no such object.</p>

<p>Note that Ada's <b>and then</b> is similar to &amp;&amp; in C and C++, and
Ada's <b>or else</b> is similar to || in C and C++.</p>

<p>Remember, <b>and then</b> evaluates the second expression only if the first
expression is True; <b>or else</b> evaluates the second expression only if the
first is False.</p>

<h2>Question</h2>
<p>
Assume that <b>N</b> has been declared <b>Float</b>, and that our program
<b>with</b>s and <b>use</b>s a math package with a square root function called
<b>Sqrt</b>.&nbsp;  Naturally, we don't want to call <b>Sqrt</b> with a negative
parameter.&nbsp;  Which of the following would be more appropriate?
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<a href="javascript:adat_toggle('adat-sca1');">if N &gt;= 0.0 <b>and then</b>
Sqrt(N) &gt; 1.618 then ...</a>
<div id="adat-sca1" class="adat-a" style="display: none"><b>You're
right!</b>&nbsp;  We want the second expression to be evaluated only if the
first expression is True, so we use <b>and then</b>.
</div></li>

<li>
<a href="javascript:adat_toggle('adat-sca2');">if N &gt;= 0.0 <b>or else</b>
Sqrt(N) &gt; 1.618 then ...</a>
<div id="adat-sca2" class="adat-a" style="display: none">No, we want the second expression to be evaluated only if the first
expression is True, so we use <b>and then</b>.</div></li>
