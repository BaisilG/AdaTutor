<h2>Hierarchical Libraries</h2>
<p>Earlier we considered a package CRT_Controller that had procedures to draw
dots, lines, and boxes.&nbsp;  Suppose that we have compiled that package and
several calling programs, and then we wish to add a procedure to draw a
circle.&nbsp;  If we add the procedure directly to CRT_Controller, we'll have to
recompile CRT_Controller, and, as a result, all of the previously written
calling programs, because these with the package.&nbsp;  This is true even
though the previously written calling programs don't call the new procedure to
draw a circle.</p>

<p>In Ada 95, we can write a <b>child package</b> to get around this
problem.&nbsp;  Its name is CRT_Controller followed by a dot and another name,
for example, <b>CRT_Controller.More</b>.&nbsp;  (The pre-supplied package
Ada.Text_IO is a child of the package Ada; that's why its name contains a
dot.)&nbsp;  A child package must be compiled after the specification of the
parent, such as CRT_Controller.&nbsp;  We do not change or recompile
CRT_Controller.&nbsp;  Instead, we put our new routines, such as Circle, in
CRT_Controller.More and compile it.</p>

<p>Now the previously written calling programs that <b>with</b> CRT_Controller
don't have to be recompiled.&nbsp;  The new programs, that can call Circle (as
well as Dot, Line, Box, etc.) should say <b>with CRT_Controller.More;</b>.&nbsp;
This automatically does <b>with CRT_Controller;</b> as well, so we don't need to
mention CRT_Controller in a <b>with</b> statement.&nbsp;  However, if we want to
use both the parent package and the child package, we must mention both in a use
statement.</p>

<p>Our new Ada 95 child package specification will look like this:
<pre class="hl">   <span class="hl kwa">package</span> CRT_Controller<span class="hl opt">.</span>More <span class="hl kwa">is</span>
      <span class="hl opt">...</span>
      <span class="hl kwa">procedure</span> Circle <span class="hl opt">... ;</span>
      <span class="hl opt">...</span>
   <span class="hl kwa">end</span> CRT_Controller<span class="hl opt">.</span>More<span class="hl opt">;</span>
</pre>
</p>

<p>A parent package can have several children, and the children can have
children, to any depth.&nbsp;  While only packages can have children, the
children themselves can be subprograms (procedures or functions) as well as
packages.</p>

<p>Although subprograms can't have &ldquo;children,&rdquo; they can, of course
locally declare other subprograms, and these declarations may say <b>is
separate</b>, even in Ada 83.</p>

<p>A child package can be made private to its parent.&nbsp;  Let's suppose that,
for some reason, we wanted the resources of CRT_Controller.More (such as Circle)
to be available only within the CTR_Controller family of packages and
subprograms.&nbsp; We can write
<pre class="hl">   <span class="hl kwa">private package</span> CRT_Controller<span class="hl opt">.</span>More <span class="hl kwa">is</span>
      <span class="hl opt">...</span>
      <span class="hl kwa">procedure</span> Circle <span class="hl opt">... ;</span>
      <span class="hl opt">...</span>
   <span class="hl kwa">end</span> CRT_Controller<span class="hl opt">.</span>More<span class="hl opt">;</span>
</pre>
</p>

<p>Now units outside this family can't <b>with</b> CRT_Controller.More, because
this package is a private child.&nbsp;  Also, the <b>specifications</b> of other
children of CRT_Controller can't <b>with</b> CRT_Controller.More either, because
if they could, they could export its resources outside the family.&nbsp;
However, the <b>bodies</b> of the other children of CRT_Controller <b>can</b>
with CRT_Controller.More, because resources in the bodies aren't available
outside the family.</p>

<p>Ada 95 hierarchical libraries and Ada 95 tagged types (discussed later) both
help support Object Oriented Design (OOD).</p>
