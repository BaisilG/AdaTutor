<h2>The Ada Compilation Environment</h2>
<p>The programs Hello and Add were complete in themselves, and we were able to
link them as main programs.&nbsp;  Of course, most Ada programs are more
complex than that, involving calls to subprograms (procedures and
functions).</p>

<p>When we compiled <a href='../adatutor/hello.ada'>HELLO.ADA</a> and
<a href='../adatutor/add.ada'>ADD.ADA</a>, the Ada compiler didn't "know" that
we were going to link them as main programs.&nbsp;  After compiling them, we
could have compiled another program that calls Hello, Add, or both, and link
that other program as the main program.&nbsp;  The Ada system doesn't know
which compilation unit is the main program until we link.</p>

<p>For example, we could create a file
<a href='../adatutor/test.ada'>TEST.ADA</a> containing the following:
<pre class="hl"><span class="hl kwa">with</span> Hello<span class="hl opt">,</span> Add<span class="hl opt">;</span>
<span class="hl kwa">procedure</span> Test <span class="hl kwa">is</span>
<span class="hl kwa">begin</span>
   Hello<span class="hl opt">;</span>
   Add<span class="hl opt">;</span>
<span class="hl kwa">end</span> Test<span class="hl opt">;</span>
</pre>
</p>

<p>This new program does nothing but call procedures Hello and Add.</p>

<p>After compiling HELLO.ADA and ADD.ADA in either order, we could compile
TEST.ADA, which <b>with</b>s Hello and Add.&nbsp; Then we could link with the
name of the main program, Test, to make an executable file.&nbsp;  Running Test
would display "Hello!" on one line and "4" (with some leading spaces) on the
next line.</p>

<p>Ada comes with several packages, such as Ada.Text_IO, that are already
compiled.&nbsp;  That's why our programs can say with <b>Ada.Text_IO;</b>
and call its procedures and functions.&nbsp;  We can also with previously
compiled procedures and functions that are not in packages, as we did with
procedures Hello and Add in the program Test above.&nbsp;  However, <b>use</b>
applies only to packages.</p>

<p>When we compile a call to a subprogram, Ada always checks that the number
and types of parameters in the call match those of the subprogram.&nbsp;  In
the example above, Hello and Add had no parameters, and Ada checked that the
calls to them in Test also had no parameters.</p>

<p>With some other languages, this checking isn't done.&nbsp;  For example, a
Fortran main program might say <b>CALL SUB(I, J, K)</b>, while the subroutine
might say <b>SUBROUTINE SUB(I, J)</b>.&nbsp;  Fortran will compile both of
these correctly, without giving any error messages or warnings.&nbsp;  When the
program is run, however, the results are unpredictable.&nbsp;  The program
might simply give wrong answers with no warning.&nbsp;  An Ada compiler always
catches that mistake!</p>

<p>In our example Test, we wrote and compiled the subprograms before the
calling program.&nbsp;  Ada also lets us write and compile the calling program
first, because we can compile a subprogram <b>specification</b> separately from
its <b>body</b>.&nbsp; (We'll learn more about that later.)&nbsp; The
specification contains the name of the subprogram, and the names, number, and
types of any parameters.&nbsp;  The specification also tells which parameters
are inputs, which are outputs, and which are both inputs and outputs.&nbsp;
That's all the information the compiler needs to compile calls to the
subprogram; the body can be supplied later.&nbsp;  When the subprogram body is
compiled, the compiler will make sure it's consistent with the
specification.&nbsp;  For example, we could compile just these two lines:
<pre class="hl">    <span class="hl kwa">procedure</span> Hello<span class="hl opt">;</span>

    <span class="hl kwa">procedure</span> Add<span class="hl opt">;</span>
</pre>
and then compile TEST.ADA.&nbsp;  We could later compile HELLO.ADA and ADD.ADA
as the procedure bodies, and then link with the name of the main program,
Test.</p>

<p>An Ada 95 compiler may defer generating code until the all the required
bodies are present; GNAT is an example of such a compiler.&nbsp;  Most
compilers, however, generate code when each unit is compiled.&nbsp;
Naturally, in any system all bodies must be present before we can link.</p>

<h2>Question</h4>
<a href="javascript:adat_toggle('adat-a1a1', 'adat-a1a2');">True</a> or
<a href="javascript:adat_toggle('adat-a1a2', 'adat-a1a1');">False</a>?&nbsp;
A procedure specification must be written before calls to the
procedure can be compiled.<br />

<div id='adat-a1a1' class='adat-a' style="display: none"><b>You're right!</b>
The specification contains all the information the compiler
needs to compile calls to the procedure.</div>
<div id='adat-a1a2' class='adat-a' style="display: none">True.&nbsp;  The
compiler needs the information in the specification to compile calls
to the procedure.&nbsp;  However, the procedure <b>body</b> can be written
later.</div>
