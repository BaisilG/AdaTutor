<h2>Preparing to Run Ada on Your Computer</h2>
<p>
Since these screens disappear, you'll probably want to refer to your printed
course notes when doing the Outside Assignments.&nbsp;  The first assignment
appears on page 8.&nbsp;  In this assignment, we'll compile, link, and run our
first two programs, Hello and Add.</p>

<p>First compile <a href='../adatutor/hello.ada'>HELLO.ADA</a>, then link, and
then execute the program.&nbsp; The exact steps will depend on the Ada compiler
you're using.&nbsp;  You'll probably have to refer to the documentation that
came with your compiler.&nbsp; Note that some implementations of Ada use the
term "binding" instead of "linking."&nbsp;  When you run the program, it should
display <b>Hello</b>!  on your screen.</p>

<p>Then compile <a href='../adatutor/add.ada'>ADD.ADA</a>, link, and run the
program.</p>

<p>When we compile, we specify the name of the source file being compiled.&nbsp;
Some, but not all, implementations of Ada assume the extension to be .ADA if
it's not specified.&nbsp;  When we link, we specify the name of the main
program.&nbsp; In these two programs, the program name agrees with the name of
the source file, without the extension.&nbsp;  The linking step produces a file
which we can execute.</p>

<p>With some Ada compilers, we must type a command to create an Ada library
before compiling.&nbsp;  For example, with one compiler we tried, we had to
type the command NEWLIB before we could compile programs.&nbsp;  However, after
typing that command only once, we could compile any number of Ada
programs.&nbsp;  Again, you'll have to consult your compiler documentation to
see if such a command is necessary.</p>

<p>If you haven't done so already, please stop reading this AdaTutor
temporarily, read page 8 of your printed course notes, and try the first
Outside Assignment.</p>

<p>When you finish Outside Assignment 1, we'll go on to discuss the Ada
compilation environment.</p>

<p>We know this first assignment wasn't very interesting, because the programs
HELLO.ADA and ADD.ADA were supplied for you.&nbsp;  But we
had to be sure we can compile, link, and execute Ada programs, so we can do the
remaining assignments.</p>

<p>The rest of the Outside Assignments should be more challenging!</p>

<p>Let's go on to discuss the Ada compilation environment.</p>
