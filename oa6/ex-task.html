<h2>Exercise in Tasking</h2>
<p>On page 33 of your printed course notes is a listing of
<b><a href='tasking.dum'>TASKING.DUM</a></b>.&nbsp;  This program calls a task
entry to display <b>Tick!</b> on the screen every five seconds until it has been
displayed nine times.</p>

<p>Every time <b>delay</b> is executed, the message <b>(5-second delay)</b> is
displayed so that the delay will be visible on the screen.&nbsp;  The program is
entirely in lower case, because your assignment is to modify it.&nbsp;  If you
make your modifications in upper case, it will be easy to see what you've
changed.</p>

<p>We want you to change the declaration of T from a single task to an
<b>array</b> of three tasks.&nbsp;  The tasks are numbered 1, 2, and 3.&nbsp;
Task 1 is to be activated every <b>two</b> five-second intervals.&nbsp;  Task 2
is to be activated every <b>three</b> five- -second intervals, and task 3, every
<b>four</b>.&nbsp;  Also, instead of displaying <b>Tick!</b>, each task will
identify itself by number, for example, <b>Task number 3 is starting</b>.&nbsp;
Output should look as shown on page 35 of your printed notes.</p>

<p>We recommend that you create an array of three counters.&nbsp;  Each counter
counts down from its period (2, 3, or 4) to zero by one count every
interval.&nbsp;  When a counter reaches zero, the corresponding task entry is
called, and the counter is reset to its period.&nbsp;  All three counters should
be initialized to zero, so that all three tasks display their messages
immediately upon activation of the program.&nbsp;  You should use the rendezvous
mechanism to inform each task of its number (1, 2, or 3).&nbsp;  Your program
should use a loop to do an orderly shutdown of all three tasks at the end.</p>

<p>Here are the steps to follow for Outside Assignment 6.&nbsp;  They're also
in your printed course notes on page 34:
<ol>
<li>Copy the file TASKING.DUM to TASKING.ADA.&nbsp;  Compile, link, and execute
the program to make sure it displays <b>Tick!</b> nine times, with a 5-second
delay after each &ldquo;Tick.&rdquo;</li>

<li>Edit TASKING.ADA to become your solution.&nbsp;  Make your changes in upper
case.</li>

<li>Compile TASKING.ADA, link, and execute.</li>

<li>Compare your output with page 35 of your printed course notes.&nbsp;  If
there are any errors, go back to step 2.</li>

<li>When your output agrees with your printed course notes, you've finished the
    assignment and will have a chance to compare your solution with ours.</li>
</ol>

Please stop reading AdaTutor temporarily, and try Outside Assignment 6.&nbsp;
Work at your own pace; there's no deadline.&nbsp;  Good luck!</p>
